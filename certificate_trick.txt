My understanding of the root website certificate problem & solution:

Since www is a subdomain of the apex website we will run into an issue when creating a repo for apex.com and www.apex.com. 
Specifically, it's possible that apex.com will work in the url box, but www.apex.com will produce a certificate/privacy error. 
We could create a second repo in gh pages for both apex.com and www.apex.com, but then we'd have to maintain two copies. 
The trick is to get github to generate a certificate for both apex.com and www.apex.com, but ultimately only keep one.
The certificate will persist for both urls, but we only need to maintain one repo. 

Note that you have to configure the DNS with the A record (Record A, Host www, Value ip_address_here) AND CNAME record 
(Record CNAME, Host www, username.github.io) so that github pages can run a DNS check. The certificate is subsequently created.
